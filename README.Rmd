The goal of updater is to ease the R update process.
The package will _re-install_ packages available on your previous version of R into the system library of your new installation.
The package uses {renv} to install the packages, adding each installation into your {renv} cache.

Importantly, the package _re-installs_ the packages and does _not_ copy them from the previous R installation library.
R packages for minor R releases (e.g. R 4.1 to R 4.2) may _not_ be compatible, which is why it's important to re-install the packages and not copy them.

## Usage

1. Record location of current R system library

    - Open your current version of R (before you update), and type `.libPaths()` into the console.
    The current R system library locations will print to the console: save these file locations, e.g. copy and past the locations into Notepad or TextEdit.
    - It may be possible to skip this step and find the library location by calling `find_previous_library_location()` from your updated R session,
      but it's recommended to use `.libPaths()` now to ensure accuracy.
      It's likely that this function only works on **Windows** machines. 
      If you are a Mac or Linux user and would like to contrbute to your OS's functionality, please file an issue on GitHub.

2. Install R

    - Download and install the new version of R from https://cran.r-project.org/.

3. Install packages

    - Open your new version of R and install the {updater} package with `install.packages("updater")`.
    - Run `updater::install_pkgs(lib.loc = c("<location(s) saved in Step 1>"))`. 
      *As mentioned above, if you didn't record the location, you may try to locate it with `find_previous_library_location()`.*
