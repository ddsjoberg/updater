find_previous_library_loc()
}
\value{
package library location
}
\description{
The function searches the system paths to find the location of the
previous R version's system library location.
It is \emph{not} recommended to use this function!
Rather, we recommend that a user simply opens the previous version of R
and runs \code{.libPaths()} to find the library location(s).
